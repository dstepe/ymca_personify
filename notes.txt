- Check how expiration date, last registration and last refund dates should be handled

- Determine start date/time for all programs

- CL_CCC_FLAG should always be N for programs?
  Camps are child care and should be Y.

- Program order detail is missing product code
  Product code is being looked up in orders for programs but not being passed to order details
  Will leave this way since lookup needs to know camp vs program, but add to program orders file

- Orders details are listed without a product code
  Orders with missing product codes were not being skipped

- Last segment of Product Code is wrong, needs to use mapping

- Sub department needs to include trailing '_'

- Skip with programs with no start date

- End date calculation needs to include more than time
  Last date of occurrence and last day of week
  What times do camps start/end?
  - Overnight programs are input as 14 hours on FRI,SAT
    Safe to ignore

- Get GL accounts from program data extract

- Camp product codes need to increment by date
  Can possibly use 'week ##' from session
  Some camps are not in date order or have duplicate weeks
    Seems to be Atrium
  Do program product also increment this same way?

- Camp start/end times
  Not fixing

- PRD end dates
  Should be one month but are a year

PRDs should have balance due, other membership orders should not
  Standard rate for membership type (should be renewal fee)
    minus
      10% for PRD A
      nothing for PRD B
      20% for PRD C

CUST_EFT_INFO
  customer id, routing number, bank account number, type of account
    start date in past, status date in past (same as start)
  Personify Order ID which draft is attached to
  Applies to membership orders only

  Order has a billing ID, see if customer ID on TRX EFT is the billable
    check if membership order billable ids are unique

  Create one EFT entry for each order using the IDs of the billable?

ORDER_DETAIL_CC_INFO
  credit cards
    ewallet - customer account as saved cc
      no order number, cc info (from customer info)
    epay - goes on order
      has order number
