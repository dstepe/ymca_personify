- Check how expiration date, last registration and last refund dates should be handled

- Determine start date/time for all programs

- CL_CCC_FLAG should always be N for programs?
  Camps are child care and should be Y.

- Program order detail is missing product code
  Product code is being looked up in orders for programs but not being passed to order details
  Will leave this way since lookup needs to know camp vs program, but add to program orders file

- Orders details are listed without a product code
  Orders with missing product codes were not being skipped

- Last segment of Product Code is wrong, needs to use mapping

- Sub department needs to include trailing '_'

- Skip with programs with no start date

- End date calculation needs to include more than time
  Last date of occurrence and last day of week
  What times do camps start/end?
  - Overnight programs are input as 14 hours on FRI,SAT
    Safe to ignore

- Get GL accounts from program data extract

- Camp product codes need to increment by date
  Can possibly use 'week ##' from session
  Some camps are not in date order or have duplicate weeks
    Seems to be Atrium
  Do program product also increment this same way?

Camp start/end times
