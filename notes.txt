Check how expiration date, last registration and last refund dates should be handled

Determine start date/time for all programs

- CL_CCC_FLAG should always be N for programs?
  Camps are child care and should be Y.

- Program order detail is missing product code
  Product code is being looked up in orders for programs but not being passed to order details
  Will leave this way since lookup needs to know camp vs program, but add to program orders file

- Orders details are listed without a product code
  Orders with missing product codes were not being skipped
